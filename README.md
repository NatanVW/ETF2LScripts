# ETF2L Scripts
Scripts for various skill checks, mostly ETF2L related

Automatic provisional tiers is still very much a work in progress, to set it up properly you will need a file not uploaded here for security reasons.
All other scripts will work fine when setup properly

### Requirements:

1. Python 3.0 or above: https://www.python.org/

2. A Python IDE like pycharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/

#### Required packages:

The easiest way to install the required packages is running the requirements file, this will install all the required packages for you.
To do so all you have to do is run the following command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal.

If this for some reason does not work you can manually install the required packages listed below. 
Read up on https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-pypi if u have no idea how to do this.
* requests
* BeautifulSoup 
* lxml
* gspread
* oauth2client

### Usage:

Set the needed parameters for the script and run it however you want. All output will be printed to the console and formatted correctly to go straight onto the ETF2L forums.
